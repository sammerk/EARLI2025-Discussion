::: notes
-   Yeah, so thank you all for your inspiring presentations and especially thank you - Elmar - for substituting Mareike who had the idea for this symposium.
-   As »The Process and the Effects of Teacher Professional Development Interventions« lies at the very heart of my research interests I really appreciate the invitation to discuss this topic with you all.
-   And as all presenters highlighted the idea of evidence informed practice I thought it might be I good idea to »eat our own dogs food« aka »practice what we preach« in that sense that I take our own advice seriosly and adapt my 10 minutes of discussion to the evidence based idea of distinguishing between feed up, feed back and feed forward

## Feed Up {{< iconify fa7-solid:circle-arrow-up >}} {.smaller}

-   **Paper 1** [@aust2025]:
    -   **RQ**: Which are the effects of two differently structured FA approaches on teachers’ beliefs (acceptability, feasibility) and behavior (fidelity, sustainability) over the implementation process of one school year?
    -   **Feed Up**: You aim at estimating **causal effects** along an explanatory research question. Hence, **internal validity** seems key to me.
-   **Paper 2** [@ehlert2025]:
    -   **RQ**: How do teachers’ beliefs \[...\] and behavior \[...\] change longitudinally during the implementation process? Can distinct clusters with specific trends be identified \[...\]?
    -   **Feed Up**: You are going to describe **change trajectories** in a population and exploratoryly identify profiles (in these changes). The first aim requires especially **external validity** and identifying profiles require sample heterogeneity.

## Feed Up {{< iconify fa7-solid:circle-arrow-up >}} {.smaller}

-   **Paper 3** [@jakobson2025]:
    -   **RQ**: How are teachers’ reading related declarative, procedural, and pedagogical knowledge related to their perceived skills? How does participating in the practice-based TPD program change teachers’ metacognitive knowledge and perceived skills?
    -   **Feed Up**: You are looking a) for a **descriptive covariation** (knowledge $\leftrightarrow$ perceived skills) and b) for a **causal effect** (TPD $\rightarrow$ meta-cognitive knowledge, perceived skills). Hence, both **internal** and **external validity** seem key to me.
-   **Paper 4** [@putzeys2025]:
    -   **RQ**:To what extent can a script \[...\] impact regulation-related interactions and text quality \[...\]?
    -   **Feed Up**: You are going to **causally explain**  effects of the script and therefore again **internal validity** is a must have.

## Feed Back {{< iconify fa7-solid:circle-arrow-left >}} {.smaller .scrollable}
-   **Paper 1:**
    -   Cluster randomization fosters internal validity while maintaining ecological settings [@hox2017].
    -   Longitudinal design controls for time constant confounders [@rohrer2023].
    -   Absence of control group limits internal validity [@shadish2001].
    -   Likewise the somewhat eclectic independent variable (e.g. dependence of feedback modality \[conversation/writing\] and formalization).
-   **Paper 2:**
    -   Multiplier mediated professional development seems highly ecologically valid (for Germany) and the results are impressive (e.g. large increase in self-reported adaptivity).
    -   While the professional development program (BISS-Transfer) promises comparably high external validity due to it's sheer size (4000+ schools/kindergartens) the selection mechanisms of the sample at hand remained unclear to me.
    -   Presenting smoothed trends with inferential uncertainty bands fits the aim of describing intraindividual changes over time very well.

## Feed Back {{< iconify fa7-solid:circle-arrow-left >}} {.smaller}
-   **Paper 3:**
    -   The roll-out of the programme for 
        - different teachers (special education vs. general education) 
        - at different qualification levels (pre-service vs. in-service) enhances the external validity.
    -   Sample sizes and unclear selection meachisms into the professional development program may harm both, internal and external validity.
-   **Paper 4:**
    -   Ecological valid setting (academic writing course).
    -   Waitlist control group design allows a compromise of external and internal validity.
    -   Within-person design assumes no primacy/recency effects.

## Feed Forward {{< iconify fa7-solid:circle-arrow-right >}} {.smaller .scrollable}
- Ecological validity: 
   - Keep it high by using »real-world materials« (P1-4), existing PD structures and institutions (P2,4), cluster randomized field trials (P1) and waitlist control groups (P4).
- Internal validity:
   - Be clear (to yourself and your readers) about your strategy for identifying causal effects.
   - Pre-Register your hypotheses and your analysis plan.
   - Use equivalence testing or Bayesian statistics to distinguish between »no effect« and »no evidence for an effect« if your *p*-values are not significant.
   - Give credit to direct replications
- External validity:
   - Keep working with heterogeneous samples (P1-2) from your target populations (P1-4).
   - Be transparent about your sample selection mechanisms.
   - Give credit to conceptual replications
